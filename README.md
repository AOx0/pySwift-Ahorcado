# pySwift-Ahorcado
Project for the Python 3 course "Aprendiz de Python 3", given by the Engeenier Luis Christian A. Coronel Ayala by part of the Universidad Panamericana



The project was developed with Xcode 12.2 Beta 3 (12B5035g), using SwiftUI, Swift 5 and the New SwiftUI Cycle.



The main objective of this project is to develop a Python based program with a SwiftUI interface, testing by this way the interoperability between Swift / SwiftUI and Python. This is my very first formal project of interoperability between any programming language.



The general structure the program has is the following one:

Every progress in the game score ore changes in the list of words or difficulty is saved in a "save.json" file created in the first run of the program and loaded in every launch.
