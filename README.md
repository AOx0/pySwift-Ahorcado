# pySwift-Ahorcado
Project for the Python 3 course "Aprendiz de Python 3", given by the Engeenier Luis Christian A. Coronel Ayala by part of the Universidad Panamericana



The project was developed with Xcode versión 12.2 (12B45b), using SwiftUI, Swift 5 and the New SwiftUI Cycle.



The main objective of this project is to develop a Python based program with a SwiftUI interface, testing by this way the interoperability between Swift / SwiftUI and Python. This is my very first formal project of interoperability between any programming language.



The general structure the program has is the following one:

Every progress in the game score ore changes in the list of words or difficulty is saved in a "save.json" file created in the first run of the program and loaded in every launch.
